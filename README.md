# Data Structures & Algorithms in Rust

My personal practice repo to get better at systems-level Rust.
Each problem is implemented with clean, idiomatic code and tests.
Inspired by LeetCode classics and common interview problems.

Includes:
- Ownership + Borrowing patterns
- Efficient and idiomatic Rust solutions
- Proper unit tests
